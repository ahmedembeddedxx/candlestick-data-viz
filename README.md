## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises financial market data, including open, close, high, and low prices for a specific asset over a given period. The data is preprocessed to ensure its suitability for candlestick chart visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain financial market data from a reliable source and preprocess it to clean and organize the data.

2. **Data Visualization**: Develop an interactive candlestick chart representing the price movements of the financial asset over time, including key elements such as open, close, high, and low prices for each time period.

3. **Technical Analysis Indicators**: Optionally, incorporate additional technical analysis indicators, such as moving averages or RSI, into the chart to provide deeper insights into market trends.

4. **User Interaction**: Design the chart to be interactive, enabling users to zoom in, pan, and explore specific time frames effortlessly.

5. **C++ Implementation**: Implement the project in C++ for efficient performance and seamless integration with existing financial systems.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the candlestick data visualization tool as a standalone application, empowering users to analyze financial market trends effectively.
